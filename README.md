Loan Default Prediction Model Summary
Overview:

The goal of this analysis was to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a loan is high risk or healthy. We used Logistic Regression for binary classification, aiming to help the company identify and minimize high-risk loans.
Results:
•	Accuracy: 99% — The model correctly predicted 99% of loans.
•	Precision (Healthy Loans): 1.00 — Perfect precision in predicting healthy loans.
•	Recall (Healthy Loans): 0.99 — Identified 99% of healthy loans.
•	Precision (High-Risk Loans): 0.86 — Predicted 86% of high-risk loans correctly.
•	Recall (High-Risk Loans): 0.94 — Identified 94% of high-risk loans.
•	F1-Score (High-Risk Loans): 0.90 — Balanced precision and recall for high-risk loans.

Summary:

The model is highly effective at predicting healthy loans and performs well for high-risk loans, with 94% recall. There is a small trade-off in precision (86%) for high-risk loans, meaning it occasionally misclassifies healthy loans as high-risk. Despite this, the model is still recommended for use in loan prediction due to its high accuracy and recall, though improvements could be made to further optimize precision.
